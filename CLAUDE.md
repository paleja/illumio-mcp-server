# Illumio MCP Server

## Illumio Rule Processing Order

Rules in Illumio are processed in this order:

1. **Essential rules** (built-in, cannot be modified)
2. **Override Deny rules** (`override: true` on deny_rules endpoint) - deny traffic that overrides all allow rules. Used for emergency blocking scenarios.
3. **Allow rules** (normal rules in rulesets) - permit traffic
4. **Deny rules** (`override: false` on deny_rules endpoint) - block specific traffic
5. **Default action** - depends on enforcement mode:
   - **Selective mode**: default is **allow all** (only deny rules are actively enforced)
   - **Full enforcement**: default is **deny all** (only explicitly allowed traffic passes)

## Ringfencing Concepts

- Apps are identified by **app + env** label combination (unique app identity)
- Ringfence = coarse-grained segmentation controlling which apps can talk to each other on All Services
- **Standard ringfence**: intra-scope allow rule + extra-scope allow rules for known remote apps
- **Selective ringfence**: adds a **deny rule** (step 4) blocking all inbound, so in selective mode (where default=allow) the deny rule enforces the ringfence. Known remote apps get **allow rules** (step 3) which are processed before the deny rule.
- Override Deny is NOT used for ringfencing. It's for emergency scenarios where you need to block traffic that would otherwise be allowed.

### Deny Consumer Flavors (deny_consumer parameter)

Illumio writes deny rules to the **source workload** (consumer side). The `deny_consumer` parameter controls where the deny rule is enforced:

- **`any`** (default): Consumer = IP list "Any (0.0.0.0/0)". Deny rule is only written to the **destination workloads** inside the scope. No impact on remote workloads. Safest option.
- **`ams`**: Consumer = All Workloads. Deny rule gets pushed to **every managed workload** outside the scope. Broader enforcement but wider blast radius.
- **`ams_and_any`**: Consumer = All Workloads + Any IP list. Maximum coverage — deny enforced at both managed source workloads and destination workloads.

## Infrastructure Service Identification

Infrastructure services (DNS, AD, NTP, logging, shared databases) are consumed by many apps and should be policy'd first during segmentation rollouts. The `identify-infrastructure-services` tool builds an app-to-app communication graph from traffic flows and computes:

- **In-degree centrality** (40% weight): How many distinct apps connect TO this service
- **Betweenness centrality** (25% weight): How often this node sits on shortest paths between other apps
- **Consumer ratio** (25% weight): in-degree / total-degree. 1.0 = pure provider (classic infra), 0.0 = pure consumer
- **Connection volume** (10% weight): Total connections as tiebreaker

Classification tiers: Core Infrastructure (>= 75), Shared Service (>= 50), Standard Application (< 50).

Key insight: infrastructure services are almost exclusively *consumed* (consumer_ratio near 1.0) while endpoints and monitoring tools are *consumers* (ratio near 0.0).

## PCE API Notes

- Deny rules use `/deny_rules` endpoint on rulesets with `"override": true/false` in payload
- Deny rules API is NOT in the OpenAPI spec (undocumented)
- `pce.rule_sets.update()` returns None - must re-fetch after update
- `resolve_labels_as` must NOT be included in deny rule payloads (causes 406)
- Draft vs Active: mutations go to `/sec_policy/draft/`, reads can use either
