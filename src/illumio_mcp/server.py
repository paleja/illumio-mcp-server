        "content": """# Illumio Rule Processing Order

Rules in Illumio are processed in strict priority order. Understanding this is CRITICAL for correct policy design.

## Processing Order (highest to lowest priority)

1. **Essential rules** — Built-in rules that cannot be modified. Always processed first.

2. **Override Deny rules** — BLOCK traffic, overriding ALL allow rules below them.
   - Created via the deny_rules API with `"override": true`
   - These deny traffic regardless of any allow rules — "this must not happen under any circumstances"
   - Use cases:
     - Emergency isolation of compromised systems
     - Hard compliance blocks (e.g., PCI zones that must never reach the internet)
     - Blocking an active attack vector
     - Any scenario where no allow rule should ever override the block
   - NEVER use override deny for normal segmentation or ringfencing — use regular deny rules instead
   - Example: "Block ALL traffic to app X immediately" or "PCI zone must never reach external networks"

3. **Allow rules** — Normal rules in rulesets that permit specific traffic.
   - This is where ringfence rules live (both intra-scope and extra-scope)
   - Processed AFTER override deny, so override deny wins if both match

4. **Deny rules** — Block specific traffic (regular deny, NOT override).
   - Created via the deny_rules API with `"override": false`
   - Processed AFTER allow rules, so allow rules take precedence
   - Used in selective enforcement ringfencing to block unknown inbound traffic
   - Known remote apps get allow rules (step 3) which are processed before this deny (step 4)

5. **Default action** — What happens when no rule matches:
   - **Selective enforcement mode**: default = ALLOW ALL (deny rules are actively enforced, everything else passes)
   - **Full enforcement mode**: default = DENY ALL (only explicitly allowed traffic passes)

## Key Implications

- Override Deny > Allow > Deny > Default
- In selective mode, you NEED a deny rule to block anything (default is allow-all)
- In full enforcement, you NEED allow rules to permit anything (default is deny-all)
- Override deny should NEVER be used for routine segmentation — it's for emergencies only
- Ringfencing uses regular deny rules (step 4) + allow rules (step 3), never override deny (step 2)

        "name": "Illumio Enforcement Modes",
        "description": "Enforcement modes control how policy rules affect workload traffic",
        "content": """# Illumio Enforcement Modes

Each workload has an enforcement mode that determines how policy affects its traffic.

## Modes (from least to most restrictive)

### Idle
- No policy enforcement at all
- VEN is installed but not actively managing firewall rules
- Used during initial deployment or troubleshooting

### Visibility Only
- VEN reports traffic flows but does NOT enforce any rules
- All traffic is allowed regardless of policy
- Used for traffic discovery and policy modeling before enforcement

### Selective Enforcement
- Default action is **ALLOW ALL**
- Only **deny rules** are actively enforced
- Allow rules exist for documentation/visibility but don't change traffic behavior
- Use case: "I want to block specific things but allow everything else"
- Ringfencing in selective mode requires a deny rule to be effective
- Good stepping stone between visibility and full enforcement

### Full Enforcement
- Default action is **DENY ALL**
- Only traffic explicitly permitted by allow rules can pass
- Most restrictive and most secure mode
- Use case: "Only explicitly allowed traffic should flow"
- Requires comprehensive policy before enabling — missing rules will break connectivity

## Recommended Rollout Order

1. **Visibility Only** — discover traffic patterns, build policy
2. **Selective Enforcement** — enforce deny rules, validate allow rules don't break anything
3. **Full Enforcement** — flip to deny-all default once policy is comprehensive

## Mixed Enforcement Warning
Having workloads in the same app with different enforcement modes is a common issue during rollouts. Use `get-workload-enforcement-status` to detect this.

    "illumio://concepts/segmentation": {
        "name": "Illumio Segmentation & Ringfencing",
        "description": "Core concepts for application segmentation and ringfencing",
        "content": """# Illumio Segmentation Concepts

## Labels
Illumio uses a label system (not traditional network zones) to identify workloads:
- **Role** — what the workload does (web, db, app-server)
- **Application** — which application it belongs to (CRM, Ordering, ELK)
- **Environment** — deployment environment (Production, Staging, Development)
- **Location** — physical or logical location (US-East, Cloud, DC1)

An application is uniquely identified by its **app + env** label combination.

## Rulesets and Scopes
- A **ruleset** contains rules and has one or more **scopes**
- A scope defines which workloads the ruleset applies to (e.g., app=CRM, env=Production)
- Rules within a ruleset are either:
  - **Intra-scope** — traffic between workloads inside the scope (unscoped_consumers=false)
  - **Extra-scope** — traffic from outside the scope into it (unscoped_consumers=true)

## Ringfencing
Ringfencing = coarse-grained app-to-app segmentation on All Services:

### Standard Ringfence
1. Create a ruleset scoped to [app, env]
2. Add an intra-scope allow rule: All Workloads -> All Workloads on All Services
3. For each remote app that needs access, add an extra-scope allow rule

### Selective Ringfence
Same as standard, plus:
4. Add a **deny rule** (regular, NOT override deny) blocking all inbound
5. The deny rule (step 4 in processing) catches unknown traffic
6. Allow rules for known remote apps (step 3 in processing) are processed first, so they pass through

### Override Deny is NOT for Ringfencing
Override deny blocks traffic above ALL allow rules. If you use it for ringfencing, your allow rules for known remote apps won't work because override deny is processed first. Override deny means "this traffic must not happen under any circumstances" — use it for emergency isolation, hard compliance blocks, or active attack response. Never for routine segmentation.

## Deny Consumer Flavors
Controls where the deny rule is enforced (Illumio writes deny rules to the consumer/source side):
- **`any`** — Consumer = IP list "Any (0.0.0.0/0)". Deny only at destination workloads. Safest.
- **`ams`** — Consumer = All Workloads. Deny pushed to every managed source workload. Broader.
- **`ams_and_any`** — Both. Maximum coverage.

## Policy Coverage
Traffic flows have a `policy_decision`:
- **allowed** — covered by active allow rules
- **potentially_blocked** — would be blocked if draft policy were provisioned
- **blocked** — currently blocked by active policy

When creating ringfence rules, remote apps are tagged:
- **already_allowed** — all flows already covered by existing policy (rule created for documentation)
- **newly_allowed** — at least one flow would be blocked without the new rule (filling a gap)

## Infrastructure Services
Infrastructure services (DNS, AD, monitoring) should be policy'd FIRST because many apps depend on them. Use `identify-infrastructure-services` to find them. If you ringfence an app before allowing its infrastructure dependencies, you break it.

        "name": "Illumio Draft vs Active Policy",
        "description": "Understanding draft and active policy states and provisioning",
        "content": """# Draft vs Active Policy

Illumio uses a two-stage policy model:

## Draft Policy
- All mutations (create, update, delete) go to `/sec_policy/draft/`
- Draft changes are NOT enforced — they're a staging area
- Multiple changes can be accumulated before provisioning
- Draft policy can be simulated: traffic flows show `potentially_blocked` for flows that WOULD be blocked if the draft were provisioned

## Active Policy
- Currently enforced policy at `/sec_policy/active/`
- Read-only — cannot be modified directly
- Only changes when draft policy is provisioned

## Provisioning
- Moves draft changes to active state
- Use `provision-policy` tool to provision
- Use `compare-draft-active` to preview what would change
- Always review draft changes before provisioning
- Provisioning is atomic — all changes go live at once

## Policy Simulation
The `policy_decision` field on traffic flows is extremely powerful:
- Shows what would happen if current draft policy were active
- `potentially_blocked` = "this traffic would break if you provision"
- Use this to validate policy BEFORE enforcing it
- The `enforcement-readiness` tool uses this to assess readiness

        "content": """# PCI-DSS v4.0 — Segmentation & Visibility with Illumio

## Overview
PCI-DSS requires organizations that handle cardholder data to implement strict network segmentation
and access controls. Illumio provides micro-segmentation that directly maps to PCI requirements.

## Key Concept: Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)
The CDE includes all systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data, plus any systems
directly connected to or supporting those systems. Proper segmentation REDUCES PCI scope by
isolating the CDE from the rest of the network.

## Requirement Mapping

### Requirement 1: Install and Maintain Network Security Controls
- **1.2.1** — Network security controls (NSCs) must restrict traffic between CDE and untrusted networks
  - Illumio: Ringfence CDE apps with `create-ringfence` using `selective=true`
  - Override deny for absolute blocks: CDE must NEVER reach certain external networks
- **1.2.5** — All services, protocols, and ports allowed must be documented and authorized
  - Illumio: `get-traffic-flows-summary` shows all observed services with policy decisions
  - `get-policy-coverage-report` identifies gaps between observed traffic and policy
- **1.3.1** — Inbound traffic to the CDE must be restricted to only necessary traffic
  - Illumio: Extra-scope allow rules in ringfence rulesets explicitly permit inbound sources
  - All other inbound is blocked by deny rule (selective) or default deny (full enforcement)
- **1.3.2** — Outbound traffic from the CDE must be restricted to only necessary traffic
  - Illumio: Create outbound rulesets scoped to CDE apps with explicit allow rules
- **1.4.1** — NSCs between trusted and untrusted networks must be implemented
  - Illumio: Enforcement mode must be `selective` or `full` for CDE workloads
  - `get-workload-enforcement-status` verifies all CDE workloads are enforced

### Requirement 2: Apply Secure Configurations
- **2.2.4** — Only necessary services, protocols, daemons, and functions are enabled
  - Illumio: `find-unmanaged-traffic` detects unauthorized services
  - Traffic flow analysis shows unnecessary port exposure

### Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems
- **6.4.1** — Public-facing web applications must be protected
  - Illumio: Identify internet-facing workloads via traffic flows from unmanaged IPs
  - Ringfence public-facing apps separately from internal CDE systems

### Requirement 7: Restrict Access to System Components
- **7.2.1** — Access control systems must restrict access based on business need
  - Illumio: Label-based policy ensures only authorized apps reach CDE
  - `compliance-check framework=pci-dss` validates rule coverage
- **7.2.5** — All application and system accounts are assigned least privilege
  - Illumio: Granular rules per port/protocol instead of "All Services" for CDE

### Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access
- **10.2.1** — Audit logs capture all access to cardholder data
  - Illumio: `get-events` provides PCE audit trail
  - Traffic flows serve as network-level access logs
- **10.4.1** — Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies
  - Illumio: `detect-lateral-movement-paths` identifies unexpected connectivity

### Requirement 11: Test Security Systems and Processes
- **11.4.1** — Penetration testing validates segmentation controls
  - Illumio: `enforcement-readiness` assesses policy completeness
  - `compare-draft-active` ensures no policy drift

## PCI-Specific High-Risk Ports
These ports require explicit allow rules and should NEVER be open to/from CDE without justification:
- **3389** (RDP) — Remote Desktop, primary attack vector
- **22** (SSH) — Secure Shell, limit to jump hosts only
- **23** (Telnet) — MUST be blocked, unencrypted protocol
- **445** (SMB) — Windows file sharing, lateral movement vector
- **1433** (MSSQL), **3306** (MySQL), **5432** (PostgreSQL), **1521** (Oracle) — Database ports, CDE core
- **27017** (MongoDB), **6379** (Redis) — NoSQL databases
- **135/139** (NetBIOS/RPC) — Windows infrastructure, restrict within CDE only

## Segmentation Validation Strategy
1. Use `identify-infrastructure-services` to find shared services CDE depends on
2. Ringfence CDE apps with `create-ringfence` (selective mode for gradual rollout)
3. Use `enforcement-readiness` to assess each CDE app before moving to full enforcement
4. Run `compliance-check framework=pci-dss` to validate against requirements
5. Use `get-policy-coverage-report` to prove all CDE traffic is policy-covered
6. Document with `get-traffic-flows-summary` showing only authorized flows remain

## Overview
SWIFT's Customer Security Programme (CSP) establishes mandatory security controls for all
organizations connected to the SWIFT network. The secure zone containing SWIFT infrastructure
must be strictly segmented from the rest of the enterprise network.

## Key Concept: SWIFT Secure Zone
The SWIFT secure zone contains all SWIFT-related components:
- SWIFT messaging interfaces (Alliance Lite2, Alliance Access, Alliance Gateway)
- SWIFT communication interfaces
- Operator PCs used to access SWIFT
- Any system that directly connects to SWIFT infrastructure

This zone MUST be isolated from the general enterprise network.

## Mandatory Control Mapping

### 1. Restrict Internet Access & Protect Critical Systems

#### 1.1: SWIFT Environment Protection
- Ensure the protection of the SWIFT infrastructure from the general IT environment
- Illumio: Ringfence SWIFT zone apps with `create-ringfence selective=true`
- Override deny to block SWIFT zone from internet access entirely
- Only explicitly authorized systems can reach SWIFT components

#### 1.2: Operating System Privileged Account Control
- Restrict and control privileged OS account usage within the SWIFT secure zone
- Illumio: Limit SSH (22) and RDP (3389) access to SWIFT systems to jump hosts only
- Explicit allow rules only for authorized admin connections

#### 1.4: Restriction of Internet Access
- SWIFT-connected systems must not have direct internet access
- Illumio: **Override deny rule** blocking all traffic from SWIFT zone to internet IPs
- This is a "must not happen under any circumstances" scenario — override deny is correct here
- `find-unmanaged-traffic` validates no unauthorized internet connections exist

### 2. Reduce Attack Surface and Vulnerabilities

#### 2.1: Internal Data Flow Security
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data flows between SWIFT components
- Illumio: Intra-scope rules control traffic within SWIFT zone
- Enforce specific port/protocol rules (not All Services) between SWIFT components

#### 2.6: Operator Session Confidentiality and Integrity
- Protect operator sessions to SWIFT-related applications
- Illumio: Allow only encrypted protocols (SSH, HTTPS) from operator PCs to SWIFT systems
- Block unencrypted protocols (Telnet 23, HTTP 80, FTP 21)

### 3. Physically Secure the Environment
(Physical controls — Illumio supports with logical segmentation of location-labeled workloads)

### 4. Prevent Compromise of Credentials

#### 4.1: Password Policy
- Enforce strong password policies for SWIFT system accounts
- Illumio: Complements by ensuring only authorized systems can attempt authentication

### 5. Manage Identities and Segregate Privileges

#### 5.1: Logical Access Control
- Enforce least-privilege access to SWIFT systems
- Illumio: Fine-grained rules restrict SWIFT zone access to specific source apps/roles
- `get-policy-coverage-report` validates all SWIFT traffic is explicitly authorized

### 6. Detect Anomalous Activity

#### 6.1: Malware Protection
- Detect and prevent malware in the SWIFT secure zone
- Illumio: Segmentation prevents malware lateral movement into/within SWIFT zone
- `detect-lateral-movement-paths` identifies potential propagation vectors

#### 6.4: Logging and Monitoring
- Record and monitor security events in the SWIFT secure zone
- Illumio: `get-events` monitors SWIFT-related policy events
- Traffic flows provide network-level audit trail for SWIFT zone

## SWIFT-Specific High-Risk Ports
Ports requiring strict control in the SWIFT secure zone:
- **3389** (RDP), **22** (SSH) — Admin access, restrict to jump hosts
- **23** (Telnet), **21** (FTP) — MUST be blocked (unencrypted)
- **80** (HTTP) — Block in favor of HTTPS only
- **1433/3306/5432** — Database access, restrict to SWIFT application servers
- **445** (SMB), **135/139** (NetBIOS) — Block within SWIFT zone

## SWIFT Segmentation Strategy
1. Label all SWIFT components with dedicated app label (e.g., app=SWIFT)
2. Create SWIFT secure zone ringfence with `create-ringfence selective=true`
3. Add **override deny** blocking SWIFT zone → internet (must never happen)
4. Add explicit allow rules for authorized connections only
5. Validate with `compliance-check` and `get-policy-coverage-report`
6. Move to full enforcement after validation

        "content": """# HIPAA Security Rule — Healthcare Segmentation with Illumio

## Overview
The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and business associates to implement
safeguards to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Network segmentation
is a key technical safeguard.

## Key Concept: ePHI Environment
Systems that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI must be identified and protected.
Segmenting ePHI systems reduces the scope of HIPAA compliance requirements.

## Safeguard Mapping

### Administrative Safeguards (§164.308)

#### §164.308(a)(1) — Security Management Process
- Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations
- Illumio: Micro-segmentation prevents lateral movement to ePHI systems
- `detect-lateral-movement-paths` identifies potential violation paths
- Override deny enables immediate containment of active violations

#### §164.308(a)(7) — Contingency Plan
- Establish policies for responding to emergencies that damage ePHI systems
- Illumio: `emergency-isolate-application` provides rapid containment
- Pre-staged draft policies enable quick recovery

### Physical Safeguards (§164.310)

#### §164.310(b) — Workstation Use
- Implement policies specifying proper functions and manner of use for workstations
- Illumio: Segment workstations by role, restrict ePHI access to authorized roles

### Technical Safeguards (§164.312)

#### §164.312(a)(1) — Access Control
- Implement technical policies to allow access only to authorized persons/software
- Illumio: Label-based policy restricts ePHI system access to authorized applications
- `create-ringfence` isolates ePHI systems from general network
- `get-policy-coverage-report` validates access control completeness

#### §164.312(b) — Audit Controls
- Implement mechanisms to record and examine activity in systems containing ePHI
- Illumio: Traffic flows provide network-level audit trail
- `get-events` provides system-level audit records

#### §164.312(c)(1) — Integrity
- Protect ePHI from improper alteration or destruction
- Illumio: Segment database systems containing ePHI
- Restrict database port access to authorized application servers only

#### §164.312(d) — Person or Entity Authentication
- Verify identity of persons/entities seeking access to ePHI
- Illumio: Network-level authentication via workload identity (VEN + labels)
- Only authenticated, labeled workloads can reach ePHI systems

#### §164.312(e)(1) — Transmission Security
- Implement technical measures to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI during transmission
- Illumio: Block unencrypted protocols (Telnet, FTP, HTTP) to/from ePHI systems
- Allow only encrypted protocols (SSH, HTTPS, TLS-wrapped database connections)

## HIPAA Segmentation Strategy
1. Label all ePHI systems (app=EMR, app=PACS, app=PatientDB, etc.)
2. Identify ePHI dependencies with `identify-infrastructure-services`
3. Ringfence each ePHI application with strict inbound/outbound controls
4. Block unencrypted protocols to ePHI zone via deny rules
5. Validate with `compliance-check` and `enforcement-readiness`
6. Monitor with continuous traffic flow analysis

        "description": "General methodology for implementing micro-segmentation with Illumio across any compliance framework",
        "content": """# Segmentation Methodology — Framework-Agnostic Best Practices

## The Segmentation Journey

### Phase 1: Discovery & Visibility
**Goal**: Understand what you have and how it communicates.

1. **Asset Discovery**
   - Deploy VEN agents on all workloads
   - `get-workloads` to inventory managed systems
   - Assign labels: app, env, role, location

2. **Traffic Discovery**
   - Set enforcement mode to `visibility_only`
   - Collect traffic flows for 30-90 days
   - `get-traffic-flows-summary` to understand communication patterns
   - `find-unmanaged-traffic` to identify blind spots

3. **Dependency Mapping**
   - `identify-infrastructure-services` to find critical shared services
   - Map app-to-app dependencies from traffic flows
   - Identify internet-facing vs internal-only applications
   - `detect-lateral-movement-paths` to understand risk exposure

### Phase 2: Policy Design
**Goal**: Design segmentation policy before enforcing it.

1. **Infrastructure First**
   - Policy infrastructure services first (DNS, AD, monitoring, backup)
   - These are consumed by many apps — if you ringfence apps without allowing infra, you break things
   - Use `identify-infrastructure-services` to prioritize

2. **Application Ringfencing**
   - `create-ringfence` for each application (dry_run=true first)
   - Review discovered remote apps and validate they should have access
   - Use `skip_allowed=true` for minimal rulesets or `false` for self-documenting ones

3. **Compliance Zone Isolation**
   - CDE (PCI), SWIFT zone, ePHI systems get additional restrictions
   - Override deny for hard blocks (e.g., "CDE must never reach internet")
   - Fine-grained rules within compliance zones (not just All Services)

4. **Policy Validation**
   - `enforcement-readiness` to assess each app
   - `get-policy-coverage-report` to measure coverage
   - `compare-draft-active` to review pending changes
   - `compliance-check` against relevant framework

### Phase 3: Enforcement Rollout
**Goal**: Progressively enforce policy with minimal disruption.

1. **Selective Enforcement First**
   - Move workloads from `visibility_only` to `selective`
   - Selective mode: default=allow, deny rules are actively enforced
   - This catches gross violations without breaking everything
   - `get-workload-enforcement-status` to track rollout progress

2. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Watch for `blocked` traffic in flows — is it intentional or a missing rule?
   - `get-policy-coverage-report` shows gaps
   - Add rules for legitimate traffic before moving to full enforcement

3. **Full Enforcement**
   - Move workloads to `full` enforcement
   - Default=deny: only explicitly allowed traffic flows
   - Start with less critical apps, build confidence
   - Critical systems last (after thorough validation)

### Phase 4: Continuous Operations
**Goal**: Maintain and improve segmentation over time.

1. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Regular `compliance-check` runs
   - `find-unmanaged-traffic` to catch new unauthorized connections
   - `get-events` for security event monitoring

2. **Policy Drift Detection**
   - `compare-draft-active` to detect uncommitted changes
   - `enforcement-readiness` scores should trend upward

3. **Incident Response**
   - Override deny for emergency isolation
   - `emergency-isolate-application` for guided incident response
   - Pre-stage containment rules in draft policy

## Common Pitfalls
- **Ringfencing without allowing infrastructure** — breaks DNS, AD, monitoring. Always identify infra first.
- **Using override deny for ringfencing** — override deny blocks above allow rules. Your app-level allow rules won't work. Use regular deny.
- **All Services rules everywhere** — coarse for ringfencing, but compliance zones need per-port/protocol rules.
- **Skipping selective enforcement** — going straight to full enforcement breaks things. Use selective as a stepping stone.
- **Not validating with traffic flows** — policy looks good on paper but real traffic patterns may differ. Always verify with actual flow data.
- **Mixed enforcement modes** — inconsistent enforcement within an app creates security gaps. Use `get-workload-enforcement-status` to detect.

    "illumio://architecture/pce-ven": {
        "name": "PCE & VEN Architecture",
        "description": "Illumio platform architecture — PCE (Policy Compute Engine) and VEN (Virtual Enforcement Node) components, deployment models, and scaling",
        "content": """# Illumio Architecture — PCE & VEN

## Two Core Components

### Policy Compute Engine (PCE)
The PCE is the central brain of Illumio. It:
- Stores all data (workloads, labels, rules, traffic flows)
- Calculates security policy and distributes it to VENs
- Provides the management UI and API
- Can scale to support hundreds of thousands of workloads

### Virtual Enforcement Node (VEN)
The VEN runs on each managed workload. It:
- Reports traffic flows and workload state back to the PCE
- Implements security policy by managing the local host firewall (iptables/Windows Firewall)
- Available for Linux, Windows, Solaris, and AIX
- Lightweight — minimal CPU, RAM, and disk usage
- Upgrades can be pushed centrally from the PCE

## PCE Deployment Options

### Cloud Service (SaaS)
- Managed by Illumio's operations team
- Quick start, no hardware required
- SOC 2-compliant, highly resilient
- Recommended for 0–10,000 workloads or organizations without deep Linux expertise

### On-Premises
- Full control over all PCE operations
- Recommended for 0–250,000 workloads
- Required for strict data residency or custodianship requirements
- Needs Linux servers with specific OS and storage requirements
- Minimum 4 servers per cluster (supports up to 10,000 workloads)
- Larger footprints support up to 25,000 workloads per cluster

### Supercluster (Large Scale)
- Federated set of clusters with near-real-time replication
- For organizations with 25,000+ managed workloads
- Single-pane-of-glass visibility across all clusters
- Each cluster can operate independently during outages
- Common pattern: regional PCE clusters (e.g., Americas, EMEA, APAC)

## Redundancy & High Availability

### Split-Cluster (Metro-Area HA)
- PCE nodes split between two data centers
- Hot-hot deployment — survives total failure of one data center
- Specific latency requirements between the two sites

### Cold-Standby (DR)
- No specific latency requirements
- Can be combined with split-cluster for full DR capability

### VEN Connectivity
- No specific latency requirement between PCE and VEN
- Global deployments work fine (e.g., PCE in North America, VENs in Asia)
- VENs continue enforcing last-known policy if PCE connectivity is lost

## PCE Hardening
- On-premises PCEs need hardening per Illumio's published hardening guide
- Protect against malicious connections and data integrity threats
- Illumio provides tools to implement recommended controls

    "illumio://concepts/workloads": {
        "name": "Workload Types & VEN Deployment",
        "description": "Managed vs unmanaged workloads, VEN deployment strategies, and workload lifecycle",
        "content": """# Illumio Workloads

## What Is a Workload?
A workload is any endpoint on your network:
- Physical or virtual server
- Public cloud instance (AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP)
- Container
- Storage appliance
- VIP on a load balancer or proxy device
- Any device with an IP address

## Two Types of Workloads

### Managed Workloads
- Have the VEN software installed and activated
- Under full management by Illumio
- VEN provides traffic visibility AND policy enforcement
- VEN reports workload state, open ports, running processes
- Can be in any enforcement mode: idle, visibility_only, selective, full

### Unmanaged Workloads
- Represented in the PCE but do NOT have VEN installed
- Important for modeling — they appear in dependency maps
- Typical for network appliances, legacy systems, or devices that can't run VEN
- Can have labels assigned for policy purposes
- Traffic TO them from managed workloads is visible
- Traffic FROM them is NOT visible (no VEN to report it)
- Use `find-unmanaged-traffic` to identify traffic involving unmanaged workloads

## VEN Deployment Strategy

### Distribution Methods
- **Automation tools**: Chef, Puppet, Ansible for Linux/Windows
- **SCCM**: Push to Windows workloads via Microsoft SCCM
- **Golden image**: Pre-install VEN in your base image, activates on deployment
- **Custom scripting**: SSH to each workload and pull the VEN package

### Deployment Order (recommended)
1. Start small — pilot with a limited set of workloads
2. Deploy to infrastructure/core services first (DNS, AD, backup)
3. Expand to business applications by criticality
4. Create unmanaged workloads for devices that can't run VEN
5. Full coverage is the goal — gaps in VEN deployment = gaps in visibility

### VEN Behavior on Activation
- Immediately establishes communication with the PCE
- Reports local network state (interfaces, open ports, processes)
- Begins providing traffic visibility
- Starts enforcing policy based on its configured enforcement mode

## Enforcement Modes per Workload
Each workload has its own enforcement mode:
- **Idle**: VEN installed but not active
- **Visibility Only**: Reports traffic, no enforcement
- **Selective**: Enforces deny rules only, default=allow
- **Full**: Enforces all rules, default=deny

**Important**: Enforcement mode is set per-workload, not globally. You can have different
modes within the same application during rollout. Use `get-workload-enforcement-status`
to detect mixed enforcement within an app (a common issue during rollouts).

## Workloads and Deny Rules
The design guide predates deny rule features. Key additions:
- **Deny rules** (regular): Written to the consumer (source) workload's firewall
- **Override deny rules**: Block traffic above all allow rules — for emergencies only
- Deny rules only apply to **managed workloads** (unmanaged workloads have no VEN to enforce them)
- The `deny_consumer` parameter controls which workloads receive the deny rule:
  - `any`: Only destination workloads get the deny rule (safest)
  - `ams`: All managed workloads get the deny rule (broader enforcement)
  - `ams_and_any`: Both (maximum coverage)

    },
    "illumio://architecture/labels": {
        "name": "Label Design (R+A+E+L)",
        "description": "Illumio's four-dimensional label model — Role, Application, Environment, Location — design principles, data quality, and governance",
        "content": """# Illumio Label Design — R+A+E+L

## The Four Dimensions

Each workload is identified by up to four labels:

| Dimension | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **R**ole | Function the workload performs | Web Server, Database, App Server, Load Balancer |
| **A**pplication | Application the workload belongs to | Payroll, CRM, ELK, SAP, Oracle EBS |
| **E**nvironment | Deployment stage | Production, Staging, QA, Development, DR |
| **L**ocation | Physical or logical location | US-East, Cloud-AWS, DC1, London, EMEA |

## Key Design Principles

### Labels Are NOT Groups
Each label dimension is **independent**. Labels combine to form a unique set of security
properties for each workload. A production HR webserver in London inherits policies from:
- All London servers
- All HR servers
- All production webservers
This intersection-based model is what makes Illumio's policy scalable.

### Consistency Within Dimensions
Each dimension should ALWAYS refer to the same logical concept:
- If Role holds application tiers (web, app, db), always use it for tiers
- Don't mix concepts (e.g., don't put sensitivity classifications in the Role dimension)
- Consistent usage enables predictable policy behavior

### Security Policies Use Labels, Not IPs
Policies are written as label-to-label rules:
- "Web servers in Production can connect to Database servers in Production on port 3306"
- NOT "10.0.1.5 can connect to 10.0.2.10 on port 3306"
- When workloads change (scale up/down, IP changes), policy automatically adapts

### Unique Application Identity
An application is identified by **App + Env** label combination:
- App=CRM, Env=Production → one application instance
- App=CRM, Env=Staging → different application instance
- Ringfencing scopes to this combination

## Data Sources for Labels

### Where to Get Label Data
- **CMDB** (ServiceNow, BMC, etc.) — most comprehensive source
- **Cloud metadata** — AWS tags, Azure tags, GCP labels
- **Hostname conventions** — parse app/env/role from naming patterns
- **API integration** — sync labels automatically from external sources
- **Manual entry** — smallest deployments or one-off systems

### Label Data Quality
- Most organizations start with 50-80% accuracy for environment labels
- Other dimensions (app, role) are often lower
- **This is OK** — Illumio is designed to work with incomplete data
- Traffic flow visibility helps you discover and correct labels
- The process of adopting Illumio improves your metadata quality

### Data Governance
- Consider appointing a **data guardian** for label quality
- Automate label sync from authoritative sources via API
- Refresh labels regularly (daily or real-time as changes occur)
- Updates to labels automatically trigger policy recalculation

## Label Design Anti-Patterns
- **Too few labels**: Everything labeled as "App=Server" — no meaningful segmentation
- **Too many roles**: Hundreds of unique roles — policy becomes unmanageable
- **Inconsistent dimensions**: Location sometimes means physical DC, sometimes means region
- **Missing labels**: Workloads without labels can't be targeted by policy
- **Stale labels**: Workload moved to production but still labeled Development

## Labels and Policy Rules
When writing rules, labels define the scope:
- **Ruleset scope**: App=CRM, Env=Production applies rules to all CRM Production workloads
- **Intra-scope rules**: Traffic between workloads in the same scope
- **Extra-scope rules**: Traffic from outside the scope into it
- **Deny rules**: Can target any label combination (but deny rules are NOT in the design guide — they were added later)

    "illumio://methodology/first-principles": {
        "name": "FIRST Principles of Security Segmentation",
        "description": "Illumio's FIRST methodology — Find, Identify, Reach out, Start, Target — the recommended approach to deploying segmentation",
        "content": """# Illumio's FIRST Principles of Security Segmentation

The FIRST Principles provide a structured methodology for deploying micro-segmentation.
Follow these in order for the highest chance of success.

## F — Find Metadata Sources

**Goal**: Know where your workload data lives before you start.

- Identify your CMDB, cloud metadata, hostname conventions, spreadsheets
- Determine which sources can provide which label dimensions (R, A, E, L)
- Assess data quality — 50-80% accuracy for environment labels is typical to start
- Plan how to sync this data to the PCE (API, manual, or hybrid)

**Illumio Tools**: `get-workloads` to see current inventory, labels reveal data gaps

## I — Identify a Label Design

**Goal**: Design your R+A+E+L label model before applying it.

- Role: what does the workload do? (web, db, app-server)
- Application: which application? (CRM, Payroll, SAP)
- Environment: what stage? (Production, Staging, Dev)
- Location: where is it? (physical DC, cloud region, regulatory jurisdiction)
- Keep each dimension consistent — same concept always
- Labels are NOT groups — they combine for unique identity

**Illumio Tools**: `get-label-dimensions` to see current label schema

## R — Reach Out to Service Owners Early

**Goal**: Engage stakeholders before enforcement begins.

- Service owners know their applications' expected traffic patterns
- They can validate dependency maps against expected behavior
- Early engagement prevents surprises when enforcement starts
- Common stakeholders:
  - Application owners (validate app-to-app communication)
  - Network team (understand existing firewall rules)
  - Security team (define compliance requirements)
  - Operations team (identify maintenance and backup traffic)

**Illumio Tools**: `get-traffic-flows-summary` produces dependency reports service owners can review

## S — Start with Core Services

**Goal**: Policy infrastructure services first — they affect everything else.

Core services are consumed by most/all workloads:
- Active Directory / LDAP
- DNS
- NTP
- Backup (NetBackup, Veeam, Commvault)
- Monitoring (Splunk, Datadog, Zabbix, Nagios)
- Patching / SCCM / WSUS
- Anti-virus / EDR management servers

**Why first?**
- Core services represent a large percentage of total traffic
- Rules for them de-clutter the dependency map
- If you ringfence an app without allowing its core service dependencies, you break it
- Core service rules are consistent across workloads — write once, apply broadly

**Illumio Tools**: `identify-infrastructure-services` uses traffic graph analysis to automatically
find core services based on connection patterns (high fan-in = provider infra, high fan-out = consumer infra)

## T — Target Ringfencing for Business Applications

**Goal**: After core services are handled, ringfence your business applications.

Ringfencing = coarse-grained segmentation at the app level:
1. Each app gets a virtual perimeter (ruleset scoped to app+env)
2. Internal communication within the app is allowed (intra-scope rule)
3. Known remote apps get explicit allow rules (extra-scope rules)
4. Unknown traffic is blocked (via deny rules in selective mode, or default-deny in full mode)

**Progressive approach**:
- Start with `dry_run=true` to preview what rules would be created
- Use `skip_allowed=false` to create rules for ALL observed traffic (self-documenting)
- Validate with `enforcement-readiness` before enforcing
- Start with selective enforcement (deny rules block, default=allow)
- Graduate to full enforcement (default=deny) after validation

**Illumio Tools**: `create-ringfence`, `enforcement-readiness`, `get-policy-coverage-report`

## Putting FIRST Together

```
Find metadata  →  Get label data into the PCE
     ↓
Identify labels  →  Design R+A+E+L model
     ↓
Reach out  →  Engage service owners, validate dependency maps
     ↓
Start with core  →  Policy DNS, AD, backup, monitoring first
     ↓
Target ringfencing  →  Ringfence business apps, progressive enforcement
```

Each step builds on the previous one. Skipping steps leads to broken connectivity,
missing policies, and frustrated stakeholders.

## Why Policy Core Services First?

### 1. They Are a Large Percentage of Traffic
Core service connections often represent 40-60% of total observed traffic.
Policy'ing them first dramatically simplifies the dependency map for application owners.

### 2. They De-Clutter the Dependency Map
Once core service rules exist, application dependency maps show only
application-specific traffic — which is what app owners need to validate.

### 3. Ringfencing Without Core Services Breaks Things
If you ringfence an application but haven't allowed DNS, AD, or monitoring:
- DNS lookups fail → app can't resolve hostnames
- AD auth fails → users can't log in
- Monitoring breaks → false alerts, SLA violations
- Backup stops → data loss risk

**Always** create core service rules before ringfencing business apps.

### 4. Core Service Rules Are Broadly Applicable
A rule like "All workloads can reach DNS on port 53" applies everywhere.
Write it once, and it covers every app you ringfence later.

## Identifying Core Services

### Automatic Detection
Use `identify-infrastructure-services` to find core services automatically.
It analyzes the app-to-app communication graph and scores services:

**Provider Infrastructure** (consumed by many apps):
- High in-degree centrality (many apps connect TO it)
- Low out-degree (doesn't initiate connections to many apps)
- Examples: DNS, AD, NTP, SCCM

**Consumer Infrastructure** (connects out to many apps):
- High out-degree centrality (connects TO many apps)
- Low in-degree (few apps connect to it)
- Examples: Monitoring, backup, log shipping, vulnerability scanners

**Scoring:**
- Provider score: 40% in-degree + 30% consumer ratio + 25% betweenness + 5% volume
- Consumer score: 40% out-degree + 30% producer ratio + 25% betweenness + 5% volume
- Mixed-traffic dampening reduces scores for bidirectional apps (those are business apps, not infra)
- Classification: Core Infrastructure (≥75), Shared Service (≥50), Standard Application (<50)

### Manual Identification
Ask your infrastructure team: "Which services do ALL servers need?"
The answer is your core services list.

## Core Service Policy Strategy

### Step 1: Identify
```
identify-infrastructure-services --env Production --min_flows 100
```

### Step 2: Label
Ensure all core service workloads have correct labels:
- Role: DNS, ActiveDirectory, Backup, Monitoring, etc.
- App: Infrastructure or the specific product name
- Env: Production (core services are almost always production)

### Step 3: Write Allow Rules
Create rulesets with broad scopes that allow core service traffic:
- "All Workloads → DNS on port 53"
- "All Workloads → AD on ports 389, 636, 88"
- "Backup servers → All Workloads on backup agent ports"

### Step 4: Validate
- `get-traffic-flows-summary` confirms traffic is policy-covered
- `get-policy-coverage-report` shows any remaining gaps

### Step 5: Then Ringfence Apps
Now that core services have rules, ringfencing business apps won't break infrastructure dependencies.

## Core Services and Deny Rules
The design guide predates deny/override deny rules. Important additions:

- **DO NOT** ringfence core services with deny rules in most cases
  - Core services need broad accessibility — deny rules restrict that
  - Exception: restrict management ports (SSH/RDP) on core service servers to jump hosts

- **Override deny** may apply to core services in emergency scenarios:
  - Compromised AD server → override deny to isolate it immediately
  - Core service with active vulnerability → override deny to block exploitation
  - These are emergency actions, not normal policy

        "name": "Ringfencing Patterns & Granularity Levels",
        "description": "Three levels of application segmentation — App Group Level, Role Level All Services, Role Level Specified Services — with deny rule integration",
        "content": """# Ringfencing Patterns — Progressive Granularity

Illumio supports multiple levels of segmentation granularity. You can mix and match
based on each application's security requirements.

## Pattern 1: App Group Level (Application Ringfencing)

**The most common pattern.** A virtual perimeter around the entire application.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  App=CRM, Env=Production                │
│                                          │
│  ┌─────┐   ┌─────┐   ┌─────┐           │
│  │ Web │←→│ App │←→│ DB  │           │
│  └─────┘   └─────┘   └─────┘           │
│     ↕ All workloads communicate freely   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↑ Only authorized external apps can enter
```

**Rules:**
- Intra-scope: All Workloads → All Workloads on All Services (free internal comms)
- Extra-scope: Specific remote apps → All Workloads on All Services
- In selective mode: Add deny rule blocking all other inbound

**Characteristics:**
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Prevents lateral movement BETWEEN applications
- Does NOT restrict lateral movement WITHIN the application
- Best balance of security vs complexity for most apps
- Most Illumio customers use this as their baseline

## Pattern 2: Role Level — All Services

**Adds role-based restrictions within the application perimeter.**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  App=CRM, Env=Production                 │
│                                           │
│  ┌─────┐   ┌─────┐   ┌─────┐            │
│  │ Web │──→│ App │──→│ DB  │            │
│  └─────┘   └─────┘   └─────┘            │
│     Web cannot directly reach DB          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Role-to-role allow rules: Web → App on All Services, App → DB on All Services
- No direct Web → DB rule (so Web can't reach the database)
- Extra-scope: External apps → specific roles only

**Characteristics:**
- More restrictive than App Group Level
- Prevents lateral movement between tiers within the app
- Still uses All Services — any port is allowed between authorized roles
- Requires knowledge of which roles talk to which

## Pattern 3: Role Level — Specified Services

**The most granular level. Role-to-role, port-by-port.**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  App=CRM, Env=Production                 │
│                                           │
│  ┌─────┐ 8443  ┌─────┐ 3306  ┌─────┐   │
│  │ Web │──────→│ App │──────→│ DB  │   │
│  └─────┘       └─────┘       └─────┘   │
│     Only specified ports allowed          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Web → App on TCP 8443 only
- App → DB on TCP 3306 only
- No other connections allowed within the app

**Characteristics:**
- Highest security — prevents lateral movement even within an app
- Requires detailed knowledge of exact ports/protocols per role
- More maintenance as applications change over time
- Recommended for **Digital Crown Jewels** (sensitive apps)

## Choosing the Right Pattern

| Factor | App Group | Role All Services | Role Specified |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Security level | Good | Better | Best |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Maintenance | Low | Medium | Higher |
| Knowledge needed | App boundaries | Role-to-role flow | Exact ports |
| Best for | Most apps | Important apps | Crown jewels |

**Recommended approach:**
- App Group Level for 80% of applications (baseline protection)
- Role Level All Services for important business apps
- Role Level Specified Services for digital crown jewels (PCI CDE, SWIFT zone, ePHI)
- You can upgrade an app's pattern anytime without changing other apps

## Deny Rules and Ringfencing (Not in Original Design Guide)

The design guide predates Illumio's deny rule feature. Here's how deny rules integrate:

### Standard Ringfencing (Full Enforcement)
- No deny rules needed — full enforcement default is DENY ALL
- Allow rules are sufficient: anything not explicitly allowed is blocked

### Selective Ringfencing (Selective Enforcement)
- Selective mode default is ALLOW ALL — deny rules are required to block traffic
- Add a **regular deny rule** (`override: false`) blocking inbound to the app scope
- Known remote apps get **allow rules** which are processed BEFORE the deny rule
- Processing order: Allow (step 3) → Deny (step 4) → Default allow

### Override Deny — NOT for Ringfencing
Override deny is processed BEFORE allow rules (step 2). If you use it for ringfencing:
- Your extra-scope allow rules for known remote apps will be OVERRIDDEN
- Nothing can get through, including legitimate traffic
- Override deny means "this must not happen under any circumstances"
- Use cases: emergency isolation, hard compliance blocks, active attack response
- NEVER use override deny for routine segmentation

### Deny Consumer Options
When adding deny rules for ringfencing:
- `any` (default): Deny rule enforced only at destination workloads. Safest.
- `ams`: Deny rule pushed to ALL managed workloads. Broader but wider blast radius.
- `ams_and_any`: Both. Maximum enforcement but highest impact.

    },
    "illumio://methodology/crown-jewels": {
        "name": "Digital Crown Jewels",
        "description": "Identifying and protecting your most sensitive applications with the highest level of segmentation control",
        "content": """# Digital Crown Jewels — Maximum Protection

## What Are Digital Crown Jewels?

Crown jewels are applications that store or process your most sensitive data:
- **Payment/financial data** — PCI cardholder data, banking systems, trading platforms
- **Personal information** — PII, PHI (health records), employee data
- **Trade secrets** — intellectual property, source code repositories, R&D systems
- **Critical infrastructure** — industrial control systems, SCADA
- **Regulatory data** — SWIFT messaging systems, SOX financial reporting
- **Authentication systems** — Active Directory, certificate authorities, identity providers

## Why Crown Jewels Need Special Treatment

Most applications can be adequately protected with **App Group Level ringfencing** —
a coarse-grained perimeter around the entire application.

Crown jewels need **Role Level Specified Services** — the most granular pattern:
- Port-by-port, protocol-by-protocol control
- Web → App on TCP 8443 ONLY, App → DB on TCP 3306 ONLY
- No "All Services" rules within the crown jewel perimeter
- This prevents lateral movement WITHIN the application

## Identifying Crown Jewels

### Ask These Questions
1. What data, if breached, would make headlines?
2. What systems, if compromised, would halt business operations?
3. What regulatory frameworks apply, and which systems are in scope?
4. What applications have the highest data sensitivity classification?

### Common Crown Jewels by Industry
| Industry | Crown Jewels |
|----------|-------------|
| Financial Services | Trading platforms, payment processing, SWIFT, core banking |
| Healthcare | EMR/EHR systems, PACS imaging, patient databases |
| Retail | POS systems, payment processing, customer databases |
| Manufacturing | SCADA/ICS, R&D systems, patent databases |
| Technology | Source code repos, CI/CD pipelines, secrets management |
| Government | Classified systems, citizen data, critical infrastructure |

## Crown Jewel Protection Strategy

### Step 1: Identify and Label
- Label crown jewel workloads with specific app and role labels
- Example: App=PaymentGateway, Role=PaymentDB, Env=Production
- Ensure 100% label accuracy — no room for error on critical systems

### Step 2: Map Dependencies
```
get-traffic-flows-summary --app PaymentGateway --env Production
identify-infrastructure-services --app PaymentGateway --env Production
```
- Document every connection, every port, every protocol
- Validate with application owners — "is this expected traffic?"
- Flag any unexpected connections for investigation

### Step 3: Write Granular Rules (Role Level Specified Services)
Instead of "All Workloads → All Workloads on All Services":
- Payment Web → Payment App on TCP 8443
- Payment App → Payment DB on TCP 3306
- Payment App → Payment Cache on TCP 6379
- Monitoring → All Roles on TCP 9100 (metrics)
- Nothing else is allowed within the perimeter

### Step 4: Add Compliance-Specific Controls
For PCI crown jewels:
- Block high-risk ports (RDP, Telnet, FTP) with deny rules
- Override deny for hard compliance blocks ("CDE must never reach internet")
- Encrypt all data-in-transit (block HTTP, require HTTPS)

For SWIFT crown jewels:
- Override deny blocking SWIFT zone → internet
- Restrict admin access (SSH/RDP) to jump hosts only
- Block all unencrypted protocols

### Step 5: Enforce Progressively
1. Visibility Only → collect traffic flows, validate rules
2. Selective → deny rules active, verify no breakage
3. Full enforcement → default=deny, only explicitly allowed traffic flows

### Step 6: Monitor Continuously
```
compliance-check --framework pci-dss --app PaymentGateway --env Production
detect-lateral-movement-paths --app PaymentGateway --env Production
enforcement-readiness --app PaymentGateway --env Production
```

## Crown Jewels and Deny/Override Deny Rules

### Regular Deny Rules for Selective Mode
- Crown jewels in selective mode NEED deny rules for ringfencing
- Block ALL inbound except explicitly allowed sources
- Use the most restrictive deny_consumer option appropriate

### Override Deny for Hard Compliance Blocks
Override deny is appropriate for crown jewels in specific scenarios:
- "PCI CDE must NEVER reach the internet" → override deny
- "SWIFT zone must NEVER have direct internet access" → override deny
- "ePHI database must NEVER be accessible from development" → override deny
- These are absolute blocks that no allow rule should ever bypass

### Override Deny is NOT for Day-to-Day Segmentation
Even for crown jewels, normal segmentation uses regular deny rules + allow rules.
Override deny is the nuclear option — use it only for compliance-mandated hard blocks
and emergency isolation scenarios.

## Maintenance Considerations
Crown jewel protection at Role Level Specified Services requires more maintenance:
- Application changes (new microservice, port change) require rule updates
- Regular reviews with application owners
- `compare-draft-active` to detect policy drift
- Automated compliance checks on a schedule
- The maintenance cost is justified by the data sensitivity

    "illumio://operations/logging-monitoring": {
        "name": "Logging, Monitoring & SIEM Integration",
        "description": "PCE logging types, SIEM integration, traffic data records, auditable events, and alerting strategies",
        "content": """# Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting with Illumio

## Three Types of PCE Log Data

### 1. PCE Internal Messages
- Unstructured log records about PCE component operations
- For support and troubleshooting only
- Managed automatically — log rotation, disk space management
- Stored in PCE log directory (on-premises)
- Not typically exported to SIEM

### 2. Auditable Events
Structured messages about significant security events:
- Agent activated / deactivated
- User password changed
- Security policy modified or provisioned
- Label created / modified / deleted
- Workload paired / unpaired
- Enforcement mode changed

**Properties:**
- Well-defined data fields (structured, parseable)
- Comply with Common Criteria Class FAU Security Audit standard
- Stored in PCE database, queryable via web UI and API
- Can be published to SIEM via syslog or Fluentd
- Available in JSON, CEF, or LEEF formats

**Illumio Tool**: `get-events` provides access to auditable events with severity filtering

### 3. Traffic Data Records
Periodic summaries of connections observed on managed workloads:
- Source and destination (IP, hostname, workload)
- Labels for source and destination (when available)
- Port, protocol, and process information
- Policy decision: **allowed**, **blocked**, or **potentially_blocked**
- Timestamp and volume data

**Traffic record types:**
- **Accepted**: Connections allowed by policy or default action
- **Blocked**: Connections denied by policy enforcement
- **Potentially Blocked**: Connections on non-enforcing workloads that WOULD be blocked if enforced

**Volume warning:** Traffic data can be very high-volume. Ensure your SIEM has sufficient capacity.

## SIEM Integration

### Supported SIEM Products
- **Splunk**: Illumio App for Splunk available on Splunkbase (turnkey integration)
- **HPE ArcSight**: CEF format output
- **IBM QRadar**: LEEF format output
- **Any syslog-compatible SIEM**: JSON, CEF, or LEEF via syslog
- **Fluentd-compatible systems**: Native Fluentd output

### Integration Architecture
```
PCE → syslog/Fluentd → SIEM
  ├── Auditable events (structured)
  └── Traffic data records (high volume)
```

### What to Send to Your SIEM
| Data Type | Volume | Value | Recommended |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Auditable events | Low | High | Always export |
| Accepted traffic | High | Medium | Export if capacity allows |
| Blocked traffic | Medium | Very High | Always export |
| Potentially blocked | Medium | High | Export during rollout |

## Alerting Strategies

### Individual Event Alerts
High-priority events to alert on immediately:
- **agent.tampering** — VEN detected unauthorized changes to local firewall rules
- **enforcement_mode_changed** — workload enforcement mode was modified
- **policy_provisioned** — security policy was pushed to active
- **workload.unpaired** — VEN was removed from a managed workload

### Aggregate/Trend Alerts
Monitor totals and trends:
- Total messages per day by type — sudden spikes indicate issues
- Blocked traffic volume increase — may indicate attack or misconfiguration
- New "potentially blocked" flows appearing — policy gaps
- Workload count changes — track VEN deployment progress

### Traffic-Based Alerting
Use traffic data records for security monitoring:
- **Cross-environment traffic**: Production ↔ Development connections (label-enriched flows make this easy)
- **Unexpected protocol usage**: Telnet, FTP on production systems
- **Lateral movement indicators**: New connections between previously unrelated apps
- **Volume anomalies**: Sudden increase in traffic to a specific workload

**Illumio Tools:**
- `detect-lateral-movement-paths` — identifies potential lateral movement vectors
- `find-unmanaged-traffic` — surfaces unknown connections
- `get-traffic-flows-summary` — comprehensive traffic analysis

## Operational Monitoring

### PCE Health (On-Premises)
- Monitor PCE component health via internal messages
- Track PCE cluster state (primary/secondary, replication lag)
- Disk space monitoring for log and database storage

### VEN Health
- Track VEN connectivity status via PCE
- Alert on VEN tamper events
- Monitor VEN version distribution for upgrade tracking

### Policy Health
- `compare-draft-active` — detect uncommitted draft changes
- `enforcement-readiness` — track enforcement rollout progress
- `compliance-check` — periodic compliance validation
- `get-policy-coverage-report` — measure policy completeness

## Traffic Data for Forensics
Traffic data records are invaluable for incident investigation:
- "Which workloads communicated with the compromised server in the last 7 days?"
- "What ports were used for connections crossing from dev to prod?"
- "When did the first unauthorized connection to the database appear?"
- Labels enrich raw flow data with business context — you don't just see IPs, you see applications

Ringfence the application {arguments['application_name']} in the environment {arguments['application_environment']}.
Always reference labels as hrefs like /orgs/1/labels/57 or similar.
Consumers means the source of the traffic, providers means the destination of the traffic.

1. First, get all the labels to have them available for later use.
2. Retrieve all the traffic flows inside the application and environment. 
   Only fetch potentially blocked or blocked traffic.Analyze the connections.
3. Then retrieve all the traffic flows inbound to the application and environment.
4. Inside the app, please be sure to have rules for each role or app tier to connect to the other tiers. 
5. Prefer the traffic summary over the traffic flow tool.

Always use traffic flows to find out what other applications and environemnts need to connect into {arguments['application_name']}, 
and then deploy rulesets to limit the inbound traffic to those applications and environments. 
For traffic that is required to connect outbound from {arguments['application_name']}, deploy rulesets to limit the 
outbound traffic to those applications and environments. If a consumer is coming from the same app and env, please use 
all workloads for the rules inside the scope (intra-scope). If it comes from the outside, please use app, env and if possible role

If a remote app is connected as destination, a new ruleset needs to be created that has the name of the remote app and env,
all incoming connections need to be added as extra-scope rules in that ruleset.
Always use hrefs for labels and workloads.
The logic in illumio is the following:

If a scope exists. Rules define connections within the scope if unscoped consumers is not set to true. Unscoped consumers define inbound traffic from things outside the scope. The unscoped consumer is a set of labels being the source of inbound traffic. Provider is the destination. For the provider a value of AMS (short for all workloads) means that a connection is allowed for all workloads inside the scope. So for example if the source is role=monitoring, app=nagios, env=prod, then the rule for the app=ordering, env=prod application would be:

  consumer: role=monitoring,app=nagios,env=prod 
  provider: role=All workloads
  service: 5666/tcp

  If a rule is setting unscoped consumers to "false", this means that the rule is intra scope. Repeating any label that is in the scope does not make sense for this. Instead use role or whatever specific label to characterize the thing in the scope.

e.g. for the loadbalancer to connect to the web-tier in ordering, prod the rule is:

scope: app=ordering, env=prod
consumers: role=loadbalancer
providers: role=web
service: 8080/tcp
unscoped consumers: false

This is a intra-scope rule allowing the role=loadbalancer,app=ordering,env=prod workloads to connect to the role=web,app=ordering,env=prod workloads on port 8080/tcp. 

For traffic that goes from the {arguments['application_name']} app to the outside, please create a ruleset with the name {arguments['application_name']}-outbound and make it scopeless.
Add all the outbound traffic to that ruleset using roles, applications and environments as labels.

EMERGENCY ISOLATION: Immediately isolate application {arguments['application_name']} in environment {arguments['application_environment']}.

This is a security incident response action. You MUST use OVERRIDE DENY rules — these are the highest priority deny rules
in Illumio that block traffic even when allow rules exist. This is the correct and ONLY use case for override deny.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT — Illumio Rule Processing Order:
1. Essential rules (built-in)
2. **Override Deny rules** — THIS IS WHAT WE USE HERE. Blocks traffic above ALL allow rules.
3. Allow rules — these CANNOT override our override deny
4. Regular deny rules — NOT sufficient for emergency isolation (allow rules are processed first)
5. Default action

Steps:
1. First, get the labels for app={arguments['application_name']} and env={arguments['application_environment']} to get their hrefs.
2. Find or create a ruleset scoped to this app+env (name it "EMERGENCY-ISOLATE-{arguments['application_name']}-{arguments['application_environment']}").
3. Create an OVERRIDE DENY rule (override_deny=true) that blocks ALL inbound traffic:
   - providers: All Workloads (ams)
   - consumers: All Workloads (ams) AND IP list Any (0.0.0.0/0)
   - ingress_services: All Services
   - unscoped_consumers: true
   - override_deny: true  ← CRITICAL: this makes it override deny, not regular deny
4. Optionally create a second override deny rule for outbound if full isolation is needed.
5. PROVISION the policy immediately using provision-policy so it takes effect.
6. Report what was created and confirm the application is now isolated.

WARNING: Override deny rules override ALL allow rules. This WILL break all connectivity to/from this application.
Only use this for genuine security incidents. To undo, delete the override deny rules and re-provision.
